                    algorithms make sure to keep the same side facing you the entire time.

                    <em> Things to know: </em>
                    
                    ***When performing the movements of the algorithm symbols keep the cube stationary, meaning the same center piece facing you the whole time. it will be important to know which side to have facing you when performing certain algorithms (it will make more sense when you get to your first algorithm)*** 
                </p>
            </div>
    <!-- ----------------------------------step 1------------------------------------------- -->
        
            <h2 class="toggle thetitle stepone" style="cursor: pointer; color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"><u>Step 1:</u>
            </h2>
            <div class="content" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                    The first step is going to be the most difficult to explain and will require you to do some imagining and visualizing to do. There are no algorithms for this step and is why it is the most difficult. But essentially your goal will be to get <q>The Cross</q>. <u>while</u> lining the colors of side pieces up with there respective sides. Throughout these 7 steps I use the example of starting with solving the blue side (you can pick anyside, but for this example we will start with the blue side)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <u><Strong>Goal For this step: </Strong></u>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="step1/CrossGoal1.jpg" width="200" height="200">
                        <img src="step1/CrossGoal2.jpg" width="200" height="200">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    <u>Further explanation:</u> for the blue side there are 4 side pieces that that have the color blue on them. (the blue side borders the red,orange,yellow & white side). therefore there should be a blue/orange side pice, blue/red side piece, blue/yellow side piece and a blue/white side piece.  Notice that the blue "cross" is solved and the side pieces are aligned with the next sides as well 
                
                    Also note when i say sides i mean the center piece. the color of the center piece represents the color of that whole side. For example in the images above, notice the orange center piece aligns with the orange side of the <u>Orange & Blue Side Piece</u> while the blue center piece aligns with the blue side of the <u>Orange & Blue Side Peice</u> It sounds more confusing when i say it like that but essentially orange center next orange side piece with blue center next to blue side piece.
                    </p>
            </div>
    <!-- ---------------------------------step 2-------------------------------------------- -->
        
            <h2 class="toggle thetitle steptwo" style="cursor: pointer; color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"><u>Step 2:</u></h2>
            <div class="content" style="display: none;"> 
                <p>
                        Next step will be to <q>fill in the 4 corner pieces</q> of the blue side. This will be your first algorithm and it requires only 3 sets of moves.
                        or what I like to call: "bring it down, move it over and bring it up". You will do this to all
                        4 corners until the first layer is complete! when performing the algorithm, always keep the blue side orientated on the top of the cube. 
                        <p>
                            ***This step also requires some envisioning & visualizing how the cube pieces change spots as you rotate the cube***
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ***Its important to first find the corner piece, then see where it needs to go, then respectively where it is in oreitation of the whole cube for the algortithm to work***

                    <br></br>
                        <img src="algo_symbols/Right side down.png" width="100" height="100">
                        <img src="algo_symbols/Bottom Layer to the right.png" width="100" height="100">
                        <img src="algo_symbols/Right side up.png" width="100" height="100">
                    <br></br>
                        In the example video I am moving the <u>blue, orange, yellow corner piece</u> into the location it needs to be. NOTICE the orientation of the peice and where it is located before the algorithm is performed. 
                    <br></br>
                        <video src="CornerPieceVid.mp4" width="150" height="150" controls></video>
                    <br></br>
                        Now this can be down the opposite side as well, if you wanted 
                        to get the corner piece from the right side up to the left, 
                        its the same algorithm, just on the left side
                    <br></br>
                        <img src="algo_symbols/Left side down.png" width="100" height="100">
                        <img src="algo_symbols/Bottom Layer to the right.png" width="100" height="100">

                    <br></br>
                        example: (in this example i am getting the blue, red and white corner piece into the location it needs to be). similar to the first step before performing the algorithm, 
                        the red side is facing me when performing the algorithm and notice the blue 
                        side of the corner piece is now facing to the right.
                    <br></br>
                        <video src="CornerPieceVid2.mp4" width="150" height="150" controls></video>

                        <p>for this step it requires some thinking... so play around with the algortihms and the orientation and see what is working and what is not. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
    <!-- ---------------------------------------step 3-------------------------------------- -->

            <div class="content" style="display: none;"> 
                <p>
                    Congratulations! you got the first layer, NOW flip the cube over so the finished layer is
                    now orientated on the bottom. Your next goal in this step is to get the <a href="layers/MiddleLayer.jpg"><u style="color: blue;">Middle Layer</u></a> solved. To do this, you will first need to locate the side pieces that will fit inbetween the two center pieces of the middle layer.
                    once you find the piece move the top layer around until the piece is lined up with one side as shown in the example.

                    Now the side piece will either need to go in to the left or to the right. Depending on which way it needs to go. 
                    
                    <br></br>
                    Moving the side piece in to the left of the side you are facing:

            Your almost there! now you will need to get "the cross". (similar to step 1, the difference being the side pieces do not need to line up with the adjecent side(that's the next step))

                <p>When performing the algorithm, ALWAYS have the unfinished side orientated on the the top side throughout the algorithm movements.

<!-- -----------------------------------------Step 5------------------------------------ -->

        <h2 class="toggle thetitle stepfive" style="cursor: pointer; color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"><u>Step 5:</u></h2>
        <div class="content" style="display: none;">
            <p>
            Now you may notice that the cross is finished but the side pieces of the cross dont line up with
            there respective sides. (as you did when you did step 1 when solving the cross)
            
            <br>
            This is the goal of step 5: to line up the side peices of cross you did in the previous step with there respective sides. 
            
            <br><br>
            You will encounter 2 scenarios: 
            <br>
            the first scenario (and most likely) is when you spin/rotate the top layer you will see 2 of the side pieces of the cross line up with there sides while the other 2 are not lined up, as <u>shown</u>
            <br>
            <img src="Step5/Scenario1.jpg" width="100" height="100">
            <img src="Step5/Scenario1_2.jpg" width="100" height="100">
            

            <br><br>
            (Take a look at the 2 images, the image is of the same cube but from both sides so you can see that on one side of the cube, the green/yellow & the green/orange side pieces of the cross are lined up while on the other side of the cube the green/white & the green/red side pieces are not lined up with there respective sides). 
            <br><br>
            With this scenario you will need to perform the algorithm 1 time. The tricky part of explaining this step is the orientation of the cube.
            Make sure the cube is orientated with the unfinished side on top,essentially you want one of the lined up sides on the facing to the right side and the other lined
            up side on what would be the back of the cube, when holding it. (again the blue side is finished and on the bottom when holding it and the green cross is on top of the cube). to check you are orientated correct. one of the NON lined up side pieces is facing you or would be considered the front of the cube and the other NON lined up side would be facing to the left and on the left side while holding the cube. NOW you can carry out the algorithm below. 
            
            <br><br>
            The second scenario is that NON of side pieces line up with there respective side, no matter how you turn the cube. so essentially just perform the algortihm below (orientated with the blue side on bottom and the green cross on top) then it should bring you to scenario 1 :D

            <br><br>
            <u><strong> The Algortithm: </strong></u>

            <p>
                Getting Close! 
                <br><br>
                Now we got the cross, WITH the side pieces lined up and the cube should look 
                like <u>this:</u>.<br>
                (view from both sides)

                <img src="step6/finishedstep5_1.jpg" width="100" height="100">
                <img src="step6/finishedstep5_2.jpg" width="100" height="100">

                <br><br>
                Next we need to orientate the cube pieces so that they are in the right spots
                This doesn't mean they need to be solve but just need to be in the location of there respective sides (this may sound confusing at first but keep reading and refering to the images throughout this step). Now! what do i Mean by <q>right spots?!?!</q>
                <br><br>
                You will encounter 1 of 3 scenarios, NON of the corner pieces are in the right spot/location, 1 is in the right spot/location or ALL are in the right spot/location
                <br><br>
                In the above image,
                you can see the corner pieces are not in the right spots/location because the colors do not
                match with the sides it is next to it. (its hard to tell from the images but refer to the other 2 scenarios for a better understanding of peices being in the right spot but not solved yet)

                <br><br> HERE we have 1 corner piece in the right spot, while the other 3 corner pieces are not. the follow images is of the same cube from different angles to see each corner piece. ***NOTICE*** the corner piece that is in the right spot (highlighted in green) looks as if you could pull the piece out rotate it and put it back in. while the others (highlighted in pink) are not in the right spot.
                
                Here is an example of when all the peices are in the <q>right spots</q>, but may not be <q> Solved</q> yet. when they are all in the right spot you can continue to step 7. ***NOTE*** that when they are in the right spot, they may already be solved, we are focusing on the pieces being in the right spot rather then them being solved in this step.
                <br>

                <br></br>
                to do this you will need to perform this algorithm 1 or 2 times. In the first scenario you will find one piece. that is in 
                the right spot. Once you found 1 piece in the right spot orientate the cube so the unsolved side is on top,
                and the corner piece that is in the right spot is in the front right corner like <u>this</u>.<br></br>
                In the second senario none of the corner pieces are in the right spot, do the algorithm from any side (as long as the unsolved layer is still orientated on top)

            (notice how the color of the corner pieces MATCH the color of the respective sides)

        <div class="content" style="display: none;">
            <p>
                You are on your last step. this algorithm can be tricky but if you remain commited it will work.
                
                you will encounter 1 of 3 scenarios:
                <style>
                    .listbackground {
                    background-color: white;
                    width: fit-content;
                    border: solid black 2px;
                    padding-left: -10px;
                    padding-right: 20px;
                }
                </style>

                <div class="listbackground">
                    <ul>
                        <li>none of the corner pieces solved</li>
                        <li>1 of the corner pieces solved</li>
                        <li>2 of the corner pieces solved</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    regardless of which scenario you get, you will simply pick a corner piece that is not solved and perform the algorithm. you will want the orientation with the corner piece that is not solved in orientated in the front right postions (see below).
                </p>

                <p>
                    essentially repeat the algorithm until the corner piece that was unsolved is solved. once its solved or fixed, move the top layer over to another unsolved piece and repeat the algorithm.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So now we have all the remaining corner pieces in the right position, some may be solved, some may not.
                    With this algorithm you will repeat it until the corner piece of the top layer is fixed, the rest of the cube
                    may not be fixed but thats okay. Once the corner piece is finished you bring the next corner piece <u>over</u>. then repeat
                    the algorithm for the next unsolved corner piece and do that until all the remaining corner pieces are fixed!
                    One thing to notice after fixing each corner piece when excuting the algorithm is that the corner of the cube should remain solved like <u>this</u>
                </p>

                <p>
                    There you go! you did it! CONGRATULATIONS!
